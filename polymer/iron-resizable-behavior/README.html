<h1 id="iron-resizable-behavior">iron-resizable-behavior</h1><p><code>IronResizableBehavior</code> is a behavior that can be used in Polymer elements to<br>coordinate the flow of resize events between “resizers” (elements that control the<br>size or hidden state of their children) and “resizables” (elements that need to be<br>notified when they are resized or un-hidden by their parents in order to take<br>action on their new measurements). </p>
<p>Elements that perform measurement should add the <code>IronResizableBehavior</code> behavior to<br>their element definition and listen for the <code>iron-resize</code> event on themselves.<br>This event will be fired when they become showing after having been hidden,<br>when they are resized explicitly by another resizable, or when the window has been<br>resized.</p>
<p>Note, the <code>iron-resize</code> event is non-bubbling.</p>
